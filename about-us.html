  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Our names are India, Penelope and Nina, and we are currently students studying at The University of Bristol. For years we have been pet-sitting for each other, which was fab, until we all wanted to go away together! We saw a gap in the market and decided to start up SWAPPET, to help out fellow pet-lovers.Over the years SWAPPET's client base has grown dramatically, and we now find holiday homes for hundreds of critters a week. From your llama to your ant farm - no matter what the pet - we'll find them a place to bunk down! Please feel free to contact us with any queries :) Happy Pet Sitting!</p>
